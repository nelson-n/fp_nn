# fp_nn
### Neural Networks built from first principles in NumPy.

### feedforward_nn
* Train a feedforward neural network for classifying handwritten digits.
* MNIST data available at: [MNIST Database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

### rnn
* Trains recurrent neural network for sentence completion/prediction using the
text of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace.
* rnn.py inspired heavily by: [pangolulu/rnn-from-scratch](https://github.com/pangolulu/rnn-from-scratch)
