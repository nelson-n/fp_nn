# fp_nn
### Neural Networks built from first principles in NumPy.

### To explore:
* Add additional hidden layers.
* Test with different activation functions.
* Add adaptive learning rate such as RMSprop.

### feedforward_nn
Train a feedforward neural network for classifying handwritten digits.
MNIST data available at: [MNIST Database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

### rnn
Trains recurrent neural network for sentence completion/prediction using the
text of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace.
